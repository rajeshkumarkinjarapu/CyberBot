# 🔐 CyberBot — An AI Chatbot for Cybersecurity Queries

# 🤖 AI Chatbot

This project is part of my Artificial Intelligence Assignment.
It demonstrates how to build a contextual AI chatbot using TensorFlow 2, Keras, and Natural Language Processing (NLP).
The model is trained on a custom intents.json dataset designed specifically for a Cybersecurity-based industry.

# ⚙️ Installation & Dependencies

Before running the chatbot, install the following dependencies 👇

pip install nltk
pip install tensorflow==2.18.0
pip install numpy

# 🧠 Project Overview

This chatbot is built using a Neural Network model to understand user queries and generate contextual responses.
It uses NLP techniques like tokenization, stemming, and bag-of-words for preprocessing the text data.
